ðŸ”§ Project Highlights:
Modular React Components: Built with reusable and organized components such as TeamCard, MatchSummary, PlayerStats, Header, Sidebar, and Dashboard. This enhances code reusability and maintainability.

Interactive UI: Users can explore detailed match summaries, team-wise stats, and individual player performances through an intuitive interface.

Real-Time Data Representation: Integrated dynamic charts (using libraries like Chart.js or Recharts) for visualizing win/loss ratios, top scorers, team standings, and more.

React Router Integration: Navigation between pages (e.g., Home, Teams, Matches, Statistics) is handled smoothly using react-router-dom.

Responsive Design: Fully mobile-friendly layout using Tailwind CSS or CSS Flexbox/Grid, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes.

Filtering and Search Features: Includes smart filtering options to sort teams, players, or seasons, and a search bar for quick access to specific information.

Data Handling: Data is loaded from structured JSON files or fetched from APIs, and dynamically rendered using React hooks like useState and useEffect.

ðŸ§° Technology Stack:
Frontend: React.js, JSX

Styling: Tailwind CSS / Custom CSS

Charts: Recharts / Chart.js

Routing: React Router DOM

Deployment: Vercel / Netlify / GitHub Pages

âœ… Outcomes & Skills Gained:
Strengthened understanding of Reactâ€™s component lifecycle, props/state management, and React Router.

Learned how to implement data visualization, enhance user experience, and structure real-world web apps.
